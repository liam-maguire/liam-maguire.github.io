<h2>New Career</h2>
My name is Liam, I am currently a business management major at the University of Maine.
If you would like to visit the University of Maine's Website you can click <a href="https://umaine.edu">here</a>.
I'm looking forward to take business classes this semester because previously I was studying civil engineering.
As I take more classes about <b>Business</b> I am becoming more interested in the subject. I enjoy learning about
the economy and different market prices. I am very excited to learn a lot more this semester.
On this <B>Web Page</B> I will show you different things about me.
