<P><h2>Activities/Hobbies</h2></P>

<P>While I was in high school I participated in multiple sports, but my favorite to play is golf.
    This is a picture of me playing golf at a course back home, named Bellevue Golf Course. It is a very nice golf
    course and if you are interested in learning more you can go to their website <a href="http://www.bellevuegolfclub.com">here</a>.
    I've been very interested in golf since my sophomore year of high school and I joined my high school team and played
    the rest of my high school career. What I like most about golf is, almost anyone can play, at any age.
    I look forward to playing a lot more golf in the future.</P>
