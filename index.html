<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!!!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

Welcome to my introduction website for the class BUA 235. My name is Liam and I from a small city
outside of <b>Boston</b>, named Melrose. I am very excited to be starting my second semester at the
University of Maine. I hope to have a very productive semester and learn a lot about <i>Business</i> and
marketing strategies. The thing I miss most about home is my dog, where you can see a picture below!
