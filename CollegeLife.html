<P><h2>College Life</h2></P>

<P>So far in college I have made a lot of new friends and have met a lot of new people. I joined a fraternity
    on campus, which I had never thought I would have done before entering college. Now I am part of Theta Chi at the
    University of Maine which is one of the best experiences of my life and would recommend it to any incoming
    college students.
