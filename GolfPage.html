<h2><B>BUA</B> 235 Wesite : Assignment 1</h2>
<P>While I was in high school I participated in multiple sports, but my favorite to play is golf.
    This is a picture of me playing golf at a course back home. I've been very interested in golf since
    my sophomore year of high school and I look forward to playing a lot more in the future.</P>
